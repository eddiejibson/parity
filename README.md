# parity
Very basic system that generates/validates a parity bit from the binary pattern provided. This was done for my computing class.

See it in action [here](https://eddiejibson.github.io/parity)

Popup modules created using [SweetalertJS](https://github.com/t4t5/sweetalert). The rest was done from scratch. No jQuery was used.
